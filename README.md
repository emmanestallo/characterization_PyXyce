# characterization_PyXyce
Sandia Xyce and Python to characterize and plot CMOS $g_m/I_D$ parameters
  
22nm PTM is found at https://ptm.asu.edu/  

Sandia Xyce runs the netlist and outputs a CSV file that contains the desired parameters.  

Xyce has no GUI so the .sp file is created through notepad.  
The results are shown below.
